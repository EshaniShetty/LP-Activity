This is my LP Activity 1 and 2

Activity 1

Q1:Using “man command” can you provide me the explanations of the output for the 
following commands:
ls -b, ls -c, ls -d, …., ls -z
Ans:
ls -a, --all

Man excerpt: -a, --all — do not ignore entries starting with .
Description: Show all directory entries, including hidden files that start with ..
Meaning / Use: Use to view dotfiles (e.g., .bashrc, .profile) and the special entries . and ... Useful for troubleshooting/configuration.
Effect on output: Adds . (current directory), .. (parent), and any other dotfiles to the listing.
Example:
ls
Desktop  Documents  Downloads
ls -a
.  ..  .bashrc  .profile  Desktop  Documents  Downloads

ls -b, --escape

Man excerpt: -b, --escape — print C-style escapes for nongraphic characters
Description: Replace nonprintable characters in filenames with backslash escapes (octal like \040 for space).
Meaning / Use: Helpful for identifying filenames that contain spaces, newlines, tabs or other weird characters.
Effect on output: Filenames are shown with escape sequences instead of invisible/control characters.
Example:
ls -b
My\040File  normal.txt
ls -lb
-rw-r--r-- 1 alice staff 1024 Aug 25 My\040File

ls -c

Man excerpt: -c — with -l/-t: use ctime (status change time)
Description: Use file ctime (time of last status change) for sorting/display when combined with other flags.
Meaning / Use: Find files whose metadata changed recently (permissions, owner, link count).
Effect on output: When combined with -l or -t, the timestamp and/or sort order reflect ctime instead of modification time.
Example:
ls -lc
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 512 Aug 26 11:40 perms_changed.conf

ls -d, --directory

Man excerpt: -d, --directory — list directories themselves, not their contents
Description: Show directory entries rather than expanding and listing their contents.
Meaning / Use: Inspect directory metadata (permissions/owner/size of the directory entry) without listing files inside.
Effect on output: For a directory argument, prints a single line for that directory (like a file).
Example:
ls -ld /etc
drwxr-xr-x 250 root root 12288 Aug 26 /etc

ls -e (implementation note)

Man excerpt: -e / --full-time (implementation dependent) — print full timestamp (including seconds/nanoseconds)
Description: Show complete timestamp with seconds and fractional seconds (on systems that support it). On many systems --full-time is the explicit option; -e may be supported in some ls versions for extended time output.
Meaning / Use: Use when you need very precise time information.
Effect on output: Time column shows full date/time including seconds and fractional seconds.
Example:
ls -le file.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 alice staff 123 Aug 26 2025 12:34:56.123456789 file.txt

If ls -e is not recognized, use ls --full-time on GNU coreutils.

ls -f

Man excerpt: -f — do not sort; output in directory order (implies -a)
Description: Disable sorting; list in filesystem/directory order. Implies -a (shows hidden files).
Meaning / Use: Fast listing for very large directories; see entries in the raw order directory stores them.
Effect on output: Names appear unsorted; hidden files are shown. Useful to see the exact directory order.
Example:
ls -f
.  ..  .hidden  file3  file1  file2

ls -F, --classify

Man excerpt: -F, --classify — append indicator (one of */=>@|) to entries
Description: Append a character to entry names showing their type: / for directories, * for executables, @ for symlinks, | for FIFOs, = for sockets (varies slightly by system).
Meaning / Use: Quickly see which entries are directories/executables/symlinks.
Effect on output: Names include a trailing indicator.
Example:
ls -F
bin/  script.sh*  link@  notes.txt

ls -g

Man excerpt: -g — like -l but do not show owner
Description: Produce long listing but omit the owner (user) column — usually used when the owner is irrelevant.
Meaning / Use: Space saver when group and perms matter but not username.
Effect on output: -l format without the owner column.
Example:
ls -lg
-rw-r--r-- 1 staff  1.2K Aug 25 notes.txt
drwxr-xr-x 2 staff  4.0K Aug 26 projects/

ls -h, --human-readable

Man excerpt: -h, --human-readable — with -l, print sizes in human readable format (e.g., 1K 234M)
Description: Convert byte counts into human-friendly units.
Meaning / Use: Easier to read file sizes than raw bytes.
Effect on output: The size column displays K, M, G units.
Example:
ls -lh
-rw-r--r-- 1 alice staff 1.2K Aug 25 notes.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 alice staff 10M  Aug 20 video.mp4

ls -i, --inode

Man excerpt: -i, --inode — print the index number (inode) of each file
Description: Show the filesystem inode number before the filename.
Meaning / Use: Useful for identifying files, finding hard links, or low-level filesystem checks.
Effect on output: An extra numeric column (inode) appears at line start.
Example:
ls -li
3054199 -rw-r--r-- 1 alice staff 1024 Aug 25 report.txt

lrwxrwxrwx 1 bob   users   11 Aug 20  link -> /etc/hosts

ls -L, --dereference

Man excerpt: -L, --dereference — when listing a symbolic link, show info for the file it points to
Description: Follow symlink(s) and display the target file’s metadata rather than the symlink itself.
Meaning / Use: Use when you want the real file’s info instead of the link’s attributes.
Effect on output: ls -lL symlink prints the target’s permissions/size/etc. (instead of l type and -> target).
Example:
ls -l link
lrwxrwxrwx 1 bob users 11 Aug 20 link -> /etc/hosts
ls -lL link
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 500 Aug 02 /etc/hosts

Example:
ls -R
.:
file1  dir1
./dir1:
file2  sub/

ls -s, --size

Man excerpt: -s, --size — print allocated block counts (in blocks) before each file
Description: Show the number of filesystem blocks used by each file (block size depends on system).
Meaning / Use: Quick view of disk usage in block units. For exact bytes, use other tools (du, stat).
Effect on output: A block count column appears at start of each line.

# (affects column wrapping; output depends on environment)

ls -x

Man excerpt: -x — list entries by lines across the page, sorted horizontally
Description: Print entries in rows across the screen (row-major), rather than down columns.
Meaning / Use: Alternative layout that can be easier to scan horizontally.
Effect on output: Layout changed; content unchanged.
Example:
ls -x
file1  file2  file3  file4

ls -X

Man excerpt: -X — sort alphabetically by extension
Description: Sort files grouped by file extension (e.g., .txt together).
Meaning / Use: Useful when you want files with same extension grouped.
Effect on output: Ordering by suffix/extension rather than whole name.
Example:

a.txt  b.txt  a.c  b.c  image.png

ls -Z / --context (SELinux), and notes about -z

Man excerpt: -Z, --context — print any SELinux security context of each file (if available)
Description: Show SELinux security context (user:role:type:level) for files on SELinux-enabled systems. Some implementations also offer -z or use uppercase -Z; check man ls on your system.
Meaning / Use: Important for administrators managing SELinux labels and permissions.
Effect on output: An extra field with the SELinux context is shown (often before size or after permissions).
Example:
ls -lZ
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root system_u:object_r:etc_t:s0 1234 Aug 26 /etc/hosts
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root system_u:object_r:etc_t:s0 4096 Aug 26 /etc/

Note: On many systems the option is -Z (capital). If your ls accepts -z for this purpose, it is implementation dependent — verify with man ls.

Q2:Can you explore the following commands on your own:
• whoami, pwd
• cd
• cd /
• cd <space> ..
• cd <space> <path
Ans:
1. whoami

Activity-2

Q3:. Using “man command” can you provide me the explanations of the output for the 
following commands:
tree -a, tree -d, tree -u, …., tree -p.

🔹 tree -a

Explanation:
The tree -a command lists all files and directories, including hidden ones (those starting with .). Normally, hidden files are skipped by default.
. (dot): Represents the current directory.
.. (dot-dot): Represents the parent directory.
Hidden files: Such as .bashrc, .config.
Sample Output:
tree -a
.
├── .hidden
├── .config
├── file1.txt
└── dir1

🔹 tree -d

Explanation:
The tree -d command shows directories only, ignoring regular files.
Useful for viewing just the folder structures
Sample Output:
tree -d
.
├── dir1
├── dir2
└── dir3

🔹 tree -u

Explanation:
The tree -u command shows the owner (user) of each file and directory.
Displays the username who owns the file.
Similar to the Owner column in ls -l.
Sample Output:
tree -u
.
├── [student] file1.txt
└── [root] dir1

🔹 tree -g
Explanation:
The tree -g command shows the group ownership of files and directories.
Displays the group name associated with each file.
Similar to the Group column in ls -l.
Sample Output:
tree -g
.
├── [staff] file1.txt
└── [root] dir1

🔹 tree -p

Explanation:
The tree -p command shows permissions for each file and directory.
Uses the same format as ls -l (e.g., drwxr-xr-x, -rw-r--r--).
Indicates who can read, write, or execute a file/directory.
Sample Output:
tree -p
.
├── [-rw-r--r--] file1.txt
└── [drwxr-xr-x] dir1

Q4: Can you explore the following commands on your own:
• ifconfig
• ping
• traceroute
• nmap
• mkdi
Ans:
🔹 ifconfig

Explanation:
The ifconfig command (interface configuration) is used to display and configure network interfaces on Linux.
Interface Name: The name of the network interface (e.g., eth0, wlan0, lo).
IP Address (inet): The IPv4 address assigned to the interface.
Netmask: The subnet mask of the network.
Broadcast Address: The broadcast address used by the interface.
MAC Address (ether): The hardware (physical) address of the network card.
RX/TX Packets: Received and transmitted packet statistics.
Sample Output:

ifconfig

lo:   inet 127.0.0.1  netmask 255.0.0.0

🔹 ping
Explanation:
The ping command tests connectivity to another host by sending ICMP echo requests.
Hostname/IP: The system you are testing connection to.
Bytes: Size of the packet sent.
Time: The round-trip time for the packet.
TTL (Time To Live): The hop limit of the packet.
Statistics: At the end, shows packet loss and average time.
Sample Output:

ping -c 3 google.com
PING google.com (142.250.185.78) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 142.250.185.78: icmp_seq=1 ttl=118 time=23.5 ms
64 bytes from 142.250.185.78: icmp_seq=2 ttl=118 time=23.3 ms
64 bytes from 142.250.185.78: icmp_seq=3 ttl=118 time=23.7 ms

--- google.com ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, avg time = 23.5 ms

🔹 traceroute

Explanation:
The traceroute command shows the path taken by packets to reach a destination host.
Hop Number: Sequence of routers along the path.
Router Address: IP or hostname of each hop.
Time: Round-trip times for packets to each hop.
Sample Output:

traceroute google.com
1  router (192.168.1.1)  1.234 ms
2  isp.net (10.20.30.1)  12.345 ms
3  142.250.185.78 (google.com)  23.456 ms

🔹 nmap

Explanation:
The nmap (Network Mapper) command is used to scan hosts for open ports and services.
Host: The target system (IP or hostname).
Port Number: The communication port being scanned.
State: Whether the port is open, closed, or filtered.
Service: The service running on that port (e.g., ssh, http).
Sample Output:

nmap localhost

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) 
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh

3306/tcp open  mysql

🔹 mkdir

Explanation:
The mkdir (make directory) command is used to create a new directory.
Directory Name: The name of the new folder to be created.
Path: If a full path is provided, it creates the directory at that location.
Options: -p allows creating parent directories if they do not exist.
Sample Output:

mkdir myfolder
